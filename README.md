# StoryDataset_AMT

Story creation is a complex and challenging task. 
Making an interesting story is even de003 manding. In this paper, we present a novel approach to build an illustration-based text story dataset. 
We collect 384 illustration006 based text stories, where each story is clas007 sified with its ending type - either a happy ending or a sad ending.
